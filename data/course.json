This course, previously listed as SP.778, is an introduction to the product design process with a focus on designing for play and entertainment.\n\nIn this course, students work in small teams of 5-6 members to design and prototype new toys. Students work closely with a local sponsor, an elementary school, and experienced mentors on a themed toy design project. Students will be introduced to the product development process, including determining customer needs; brainstorming; estimation; sketching; sketch modeling; concept development; design aesthetics; detailed design; prototyping; and written, visual, and oral communication.\n\nAt the end of the course, students present their toy products at the Playsentations to toy designers, engineers, elementary school children and the MIT community.\n\nFor more information about this course, see the [2.00B Web site](http://web.mit.edu/2.00b/www/index.html).\n",
