2008 Projects
-------------

The theme for Toy Product Design 2008 was toys that inspire or teach science and engineering. Throughout the semester the students collaborated with representatives from the Museum of Science, the MIT Museum, Hasbro, and high school students in the MIT-Lawrence program.

Five products presented at the Toy Design Final Presentation.

Each team began the toy-design process by creating concept drawings of three different ideas for dental products. The team members then made sketch models, which are quick and simple models used to test their ideas. With customer and mentor advice, the teams then chose two of their ideas for which they further developed the most critical design elements. Finally, each team made an alpha prototype of their best concept that worked and looked like a real product.

Five Products were presented at the Toy Design Final Presentation.  These products include: 

[R2D2ooth]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/projects/r2d2ooth) - ejects Light Saber-like toothbrush that illuminates when in use  
Red Team: Harry Lichter, Mario Bollini, Megan Roberts, Roberto Velazquez, Rebecca Romatoski, Tammy Tasoff
